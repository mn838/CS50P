Exceptions

exceptions - things that go wrong within our coding
SyntaxError - those that require you to double-check that yo typed in your code correction 

Runtime Errors
    those created by unexpected behavior within your code
    programmers must be defensive to ensure that our users are entering what we expected
    effective strategy to fic this potential error would be to create "error handling: to ensure the user behaves as we intend

`try`
    try and except are ways of testing our user input before something goes wrong

    try:
        x = int( input( "What is X? " ) )
    except ValueError:
        print( "x is not an integer" )
    
    print( f"x is {x}" )


`else`
    adjust your code with else

    try:
        x = int( input( "What's x?" ) )
    except ValueError:
        print( "x is not an integer" )
    else:
        print( f"x is {x}" )
